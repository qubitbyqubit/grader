# This is the answer key for "Day 5: Leet Code Challenge".
#
# So there isn't actually any real useful data here yet. But, here's the idea: this file  will hold data 
# about the answers to its respective assignment using the following data structure hirearchy:
# 
# If you're lost, say the following lines out loud and replace --> with "holds"
#
# Answer_Key --> Problem --> Test_Case --> input
#                                      --> expected_output
#
# Here's an example:
# day5lc_key --> problem1 --> tc1 --> {...} # dictionary of [key : value] of var_name : var_val
#                                 --> "Yes" 
#            --> problem2 --> tc1 --> {...} # dictionary of [key : value] of var_name : var_val
#                                 --> 4
